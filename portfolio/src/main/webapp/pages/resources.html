                When beginning any new venture, the vast amount of information available can be wildly overwhelming. 
                    This fact is only amplified by the field of computer science. While there is so much great educational 
                    content available for free online, this content often takes a hefty amount of time to reach you, even 
                    if you are a diligent web-surfer. To save you valuable time from trudging through the web, we have compiled
                    a very small list of resources for various topics (some that helped teach us how to build this project!), 
                    which will hopefully push you in the right direction and pique your interests! The aim of this resource page
                    is to present a concise springboard, as listing so many different resources can get cluttered extremely
                    fast without having to direct you to many different webpages or making a super long single page. This 
                    page is currently primarily tailored toward high-school and college students, but we hope that beginners
                    of any background will find it useful!
